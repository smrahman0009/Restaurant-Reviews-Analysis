1,"Went for lunch this afternoon. They have a prime location, service was pretty friendly and the restaurant looked clean. All good things, right? So why the low score?The food, unfortunately. I got a large donair and a 500ml soda - $17.00. Kind of expensive, had a 6-7minute wait for food that was, sadly, bland. The donair meat was pretty tasteless, and same goes for the donair sauce. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience. I won't be returning for donair in the future."
2,"Very good but nothing special.  The shawarma is as expected and does not disappoint.  This is a chain restaurant and it shows but they have won awards in the past.  Just be careful when asking for everything on it because it doesn't include everything, just 4 ingredients other than the chicken.  You have to ask."
3,"Most reliable shawerma place in Halifax and they also make the best poutine. Affordable food, handsome staff, good stuff. keep it going. yee haw."
4,"I was torn with how to rate this place. If you're going to dine in, great choice. If you're going to get delivery, awful choice. First off, they charge you $4 for delivery no matter where you are located, if you're using an app, calling in, they don't care. Second, they charge several dollars for a container of garlic sauce that lasts about 5 minutes. Mine runs out after smothering my large pizza with it. Third, delivery takes forever even though they are just a few minutes away from me. and fourth, the food has gone downhill. I'm not sure if it's a new cook in there or what but it just doesn't do it for me anymore. The chicken is always dry now, most likely from the delivery taking over an hour."
5,"I have no idea why I haven't written a review for here yet, considering it's one place I frequent quite often.What's better than getting a meal that fills you beyond your comprehension for 10 dollars? I love that Mezza is so vegan-friendly except for the giant rotisseries of meat haha that I tend to have to pretend aren't there. I never liked falafel's before Mezza and now I'm a huge fan and crave their's all the time. They have the best sauce and the pickled turnip is to die for! I also LOVE their french fries. Inexpensive, delicious, filling, vegan food, nothing better!"
6,"This is going to be really controversial but...I don't see the appeal of donairs. Do I get kicked out of Halifax now?So when my husband suggested we go to Mezza for donairs when my brother was in town from Alberta, I groaned a bit. I just don't understand Halifax's love affair with donairs. But..my brother wanted a Halifax donair experience so we went.And I was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike donairs, but I don't love them either. If I'm going to eat a donair, it's going to be at Mezza. The meat isn't dry like other places I've been to, and the spices are juuuust donair-y enough. Also...can you say filling? You won't be hungry leaving Mezza!"
7,"I have been dying to try a donair in Halifax and finally got to try one. Apparently this is a chain and the food is cheap and good. I just wish it wasn't blazing hot inside.The donairs come in 2 sizes. I always think that I can eat more than I can actually eat so I wenr for the large. But let me tell you that the large is very filling and I was not able to finish it.The beef in the donair is cooked to perfection, its slightly crispy on one side which I love. The sweet sauce on the beef makes it even better. Make sure you get all the vegetables and always say yes to all sauces.They even sell pizza here and there is a bathroom downstairs. I'd love to come back for a donair!"
8,Pretty good shawarma place; got the shawarma plate for 10$ and was actually pretty good even though it's a chain. Def ask for garlic sauce. Not sure about the rice. Everything else was very good.
9,"Delicious food, great deal, large portions. Very nice folks. Ingot the grilled plate and it was plenty for dinner."
10,"So I will start it saying that I am from Ottawa which has a large Lebanese community and tones of shawarma restaurants. I was loving the idea of a shawarma while here in Halifax. I know, donair is the deal, but.... my hotel is right downtown so I checked out Mazza. Nice looking place, like the simplicity of their menu. Asked for a large chicken but notice immediately that the large is not what I am used to. The normal is about a 6 inch pita, the large was about 7 inch (vs a double or 12 in in Ottawa). Was $9; got it loaded. It was pretty good, awesome garlic sauce, chicken was dry. I ate the whole thing, was good, but to me, very expensive. To compare, I am stuffed with a regular elsewhere. I won't get it again, but if you aren't used to Ottawa shawarma, get it, Halifax is just expensive."
11,Not great. Chicken is very dry and the garlic sauce hardly tastes like garlic. I was disappointed
12,"Bad experience with the guy who prepared my food. It was this tall skinny guy who is probably arab wearing a golden ring, and silver bracelet, on this right arm, and a cap. He was preparing the food at around 7:40pm on Tuesday night of November 14. He prepared the fries for my food in a way that he didn't rinsed them well after fry them, and he didn't add the red condiment cause he was lazy, and that made my food taste weird, and greasy. This is the second time this guy does that. Next time I see him serving the food, I will just go to any other place to eat."

15,"I must say I've eaten at Mezza a number of times, but not this location. Little disappointed. Donair was not spicy at all and they must charge extra for Donair sauce because there was hardly any Donair sauce on it at all. To be fair, I have had other food for Mezza and enjoyed it. Maybe it was just a bad day for Mezza, and I will try it again later to be fair."
16,Now I went to this place so much when I was younger and it was called Venus pizza. Their donair is not what they do best. The meat though unique in taste is not what many feel donair meat should taste like. Their sauce (sorry to say) is not good. Its very runny and they load it with too much sugar. If ordered on your donair will become a soggy mess. But the are open late when stumbling from the bar.Their falafel is another story but that's for another review!
17,"The atmosphere is probably Turkish,  very plain and not air conditioned  but let me tell you that the food is great. I had a gourmet falafel which was full of made on site ingredients. The staff is very good.  I was going to skip the pickled turnip but I was given a sample and the processing explained to me. It was a good place to  go, don't judge a place by your initial impression."
18,"I went here with two friends for late night chicken shawarma wraps. The food was fresh and delicious and the staff was very friendly, prompt and courteous. Well done!"
19,"The delivery service is terrible, they always forget at least one thing like last night, we ordered a pizza and requested sauce on the side and they forgot it, I called right away hoping they could catch the delivery guy but the guy who answered told me he 'didn't know what was going on' and then proceeded to tell me that he would let the delivery guy know when he got back to the store, we never heard back from them. Another time they forgot a whole shawarma and I was still charged for it. Other than that their food is normally pretty great they just have terrible service."
20,"Since coming to Halifax I've had nothing but subpar shawarma. Either living in Ottawa has caused me to be completely spoiled or the shawarma in Halifax is just bad. However, one thing thats completely inexcusable is the fact that the service here is also bad. Really bad. I've actually had a few incidences where the service has been appalling, to name a few they tried to charge me a $15 delivery fee, and overcharged my friend who was clearly drunker than I was an extra $5. Why do I keep coming here you ask? Because well, as far as shawarma goes in the HRM I've had some horrible ones but this place comes as close to the ones we get back in Ottawa.The garlic sauce here is actually quite good, not overpowering but its garlicky enough that you'll need to chew gum later. The chicken is also pretty good, its consistently busy here, and busy shawarma restaurants are usually the best because the meat is getting shaved off enough so it doesn't dry out easily. I'm not sure what makes it lacking compared to Ottawa though, the toppings maybe? The pickles aren't the long, tangy ones you find at the Lebanese grocery stores and I don't think they're as good either. Overall:Food: 3/5Service: 1/5"
21,"#BurgerWeek2016 #round8 When you take a place with quality ingredients , throw all those ingredients on a burger it's hard to go wrong! Nicely spiced chicken! Delicious pickles and beets! and a unique garlic taziki sauce brings it all together on brioche bun! My only complaint , lots of moving parts made for a messy eat! Although that was an after thought! Great Burger! Service 8/10!"
22,"I love eating at Mezza, I'm new to Halifax and a vegetarian but Mezza did not disappoint me. I visited this location consecutively thrice and was always served the way I like. I eat the gourmet falafel plate and have tried the wrap too :) plate is definitely something to try. Tasty and stomach filling :)"
23,"Dirty, very poor service, and rude staff. Avoid!Chicken shawarma is overpriced and not very authentic."
24,It's just not real chicken shawarma. It's just cold sliced chicken breast on a pita. They didn't even put parsley on unless you ask for it. Pickled turnips were dry and discoloured. Hummus didn't taste like anything. Chicken was dry and lack luster. They don't even toast it for you. I was less than impressed.

26,"Ordered a shwarma plate.( 10$). The pizza slices looked really good too, which is extremely rare in NS.It was great, couldn't eat it all, a ton of meat was sliced to order , great spicy fresh cut fries, fresh veg/salad/hummus was great. Only one cranky employee, probably cause she works too hard so go easy on her, rest were fine. Im going to stick to this place for my shwarma, havent had a better one in NS."
27,"Ok I have not been at this location since it changed into mezza but like the sharwama that used to be here so I though I would give it a try.  I had ordered two sharwama plates and two cokes and it came to a little over 30. I kinda thought that was a bit high for the type of location it is as it's mainly a stop and go kinda place. They do have tables where you can eat in but it's nothing fancy and the tables did not seem to be cleaned very well and the place only had one other person eating while we were there.The food was very tasty and presented well. The plate consisted of a handfull of fries or rice, a table spoon of hummus , a small dip cup of garlic sauce, about 1/2 cup of tabbouleh salad , a few stcks of pickled trurnip and 1/2 cup of very thinly sliced chicken.  And a small pita.I did like the whole thing , the chicken was very moist and flavorful there was just not a lot of it, and they dumped it on top of the fries and because it was so thinly sliced it kinda got lost in the fries, knowing how they plate it next time I will get the rice. The tabbouleh was very tasty, I love this salad and I ended up eating my girlfriends as well as she does not like it. I did not as to substitute it for anything else as it was all in hot trays behind the counter and they did not have anything else to swap it for.All in all I would got back thou next time I would get the sharwama wrap as from what I saw its half the price of the plate and you get a lot more of the chicken"
28,"I was literally just in today to grab some lunch.  I noticed a sign on their door saying they're changing their name to Mezza (Mezza Kitchen I think?).  Cool.  Mezza is one of my faves so this has to be a good thing. I order up my falafel plate to go.  Its piled high with hummus, olives, tabouleh, pita, and 3 good size falafel balls, along with various pickled accoutrements.  I'm quite excited so hustle my butt back to work so I can dig in. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.  The falafel, which is a favorite of mine, is not so great.  I'm used to light, fluffy and flavorful falafel.  This stuff is dry and bland - maybe it has something to do with the fact that they go reheated in the microwave?  I'm not a huge tabouleh fan but this stuff is OK.  The hummus is good, thankfully.  I could have done with more than just 3 olives though, but that's more of a personal ""I can't eat enough olives"" thing.  Was lunch terrible? No.  Was it ""OMGINEEDTOGETMOREOFTHISRIGHTNOW"" good?  No.  For $11 for the plate, while a fair enough price, I was expecting a bit more yum."
29,"If you are visiting Halifax, there are two things you have to try: Donair and Garlic finger. Neither one is particularly good for your healthy, but delicious. Mezza's donair is no different. Very reasonable prices and delicious food."
30,"I must say I've eaten at Mezza a number of times, but not this location. Little disappointed. Donair was not spicy at all and they must charge extra for Donair sauce because there was hardly any Donair sauce on it at all. To be fair, I have had other food for Mezza and enjoyed it. Maybe it was just a bad day for Mezza, and I will try it again later to be fair."
31,"Our workplace orders from Mezza a lot, and are generally satisfied. This last time the person taking the order was quite rude and difficult to understand as we placed our order. Once clarified we waited eagerly. . . . when it arrived the wraps were beyond soggy, one wrap was completly wrong, an order of fries and our garlic sauces were missing. We called back to explain the erros, though the written reciept looked like they understoof our order. They were again rude on the phone, and when they delivered the missing items they blamed us for not being clear."
32,"Bad experience with the guy who prepared my food. It was this tall skinny guy who is probably arab wearing a golden ring, and silver bracelet, on this right arm, and a cap.

This is the second time this guy does that. Next time I see him serving the food, I will just go to any other place to eat."
33,Went here the other day after hearing about their delicious food in the recent Coast food review special. And the shawarma was great! Only weird thing was that the olives had pits in them...if you are offering them as an additive to the wrap make sure they are pitted. I was lucky and the server there warned me of them so i go them in a small container on the side. I would like to go back and try some more of the dishes there :)
34,"While the food here is OK, I find it very expensive compared to other options. On top of that, they do not keep the food prewarmed, so you will have the experience of watching them microwave your rice in front of you. I found their website confusing, as they have several locations, each with their own menu, and it is not very mobile browsing friendly. Also, when I called ahead to order, I had difficulty in making myself clear to the person taking my order, who then changed it as he didn't understand what I was trying to order. Their tabouli salad is very potent, the shawarma is a little grainy, and while the garlic paste is good, it is a little runny and under flavored."
35,"Best food I've had in a long time.  The plates are massive and for what you get, seriously under priced.  This is now one of my favorite places to go for food."
36,"Best shawarma and donair in the city IMHO. Service is always fast, the restaurant is clean, friendly staff (I've even caught them singing to the music on occasion)."
37,"I  am so disappointed with the huge drop in quality as compared to my past experiences here. I ordered from my hotel room and they sent over stale bread, dry chicken and no cutlery. As if they are getting rid of their old stock to delivery customers. When I called them back, I got empty apologies and they offered to send me fresh bread.  Now that my food is cold from waiting more than another 30 minutes for the bread on top of the 60 minutes I waited for my food, the bread has not arrived. Never again."
38,"Spend my summers in NS, and I travel the province and have been across the country, so I know what good Middle Eastern cuisine is. With that said , went to Mezza and found the  Cole Harbour, staff completely disorganized , and discombobulated . Food is alright but over priced for the quantity and quality of the food . Comparing similar  Fast food Lebanese food establishments, in California or Montreal/Ottawa where you get Shawarma straight off the skewer ,  fresh hot and juicy. Mezza instead   has it in a tray , already cut in to pieces, which completely looks unappetizing to the eye and can be bought in grocery stores like Costco. Also makes me wonder how long its been sitting there, and why isn't cut fresh for each customer.   Also the shawarma pita sandwich is small, and costs 12$ including tax. Definitely lacking in value and is less than appealing to anyone that knows what good quality Lebanese food tastes like."
39,"I went here with two friends for late night chicken shawarma wraps. The food was fresh and delicious and the staff was very friendly, prompt and courteous. Well done!"

41,"Went in there once for a chicken shawarma . The owner was dancing around and singing for the women clearly out of his league but whatever that's not going to affect my review . He then went from nice to short and non sweet with me ""what do you want "" ""can I get a chicken shawarma with lettuce , sauce , and cheese "" . He made my food as I waited and left . I came home to bite into my shawarma and there was literally lettuce , sauce , and cheese no chicken!!! If I wanted that I would of asked for a veggie wrap but when you say the words chicken shawarma it is included . Yes folks I paid $10 for lettuce and cheese and some garlic sauce . Guess it was my fault for not staring at every ingredient he put in , maybe if he was doing his job instead of trying to pick up women would of had a better experience ."
42,Great place for Lebanese fast food. But next time I would ask them to put more garlic suace.
43,"With all the best of awards for the Shawarma and write ups in the coast I decided to give it a try. While it was being made I really wish I did not. Really skimpy on ingredients and what looked like overkill on sauce after I started eating it all 5 or 6 mouthfuls for a large (just under 20 bucks for 2) I did not even notice the sauce the meat was so so dry. It was really bad and after I had it one for me and one for my wife we both had to make dinner at home? We were eating out as a treat and to save us the trouble of cooking and had to cook anyway. What a joke of a wrap this thing was. I have eaten at Tarek's café often on robie and have never been let down and for price it comes to just over 6 bucks with tax for a wrap at tarek's and mezza wants over 9 with tax for a much lesser product. I really do not get all the fan fair over mezza? Really simple toppings as well pickles, iceburg etc.. Tareks loads it up with everything. I will not be returning to Mezza."
